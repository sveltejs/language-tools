# Contributing to Svelte Language Tools

Svelte Language Tools provides IDE support for Svelte files through the Language Server Protocol (LSP). It powers the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) and enables Svelte support in [numerous other IDEs](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/tools/).

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies. These resources help people who want to learn how to run and contribute to open source projects. Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

-   [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
-   [Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)

## Get involved

There are many ways to contribute to Svelte Language Tools, and many of them do not involve writing any code. Here's a few ideas to get started:

-   Simply start using Svelte Language Tools in your IDE. Does everything work as expected? If not, we're always looking for improvements. Let us know by [opening an issue](#reporting-new-issues).
-   Look through the [open issues](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/issues). A good starting point would be issues tagged [good first issue](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). Provide workarounds, ask for clarification, or suggest labels. Help [triage issues](#triaging-issues-and-pull-requests).
-   If you find an issue you would like to fix, [open a pull request](#pull-requests).
-   Read through our [documentation](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/tree/master/docs). If you find anything that is confusing or can be improved, you can make edits by opening a pull request.
-   Take a look at the [features requested](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/labels/enhancement) by others in the community and consider opening a pull request if you see something you want to work on.

Contributions are very welcome. If you think you need help planning your contribution, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://svelte.dev/chat) and let us know you are looking for a bit of help.

## Triaging issues and pull requests

One great way you can contribute to the project without writing any code is to help triage issues and pull requests as they come in.

-   Ask for more information if the issue does not provide all the details required by the template.
-   Suggest [labels](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/labels) that can help categorize issues.
-   Flag issues that are stale or that should be closed.
-   Ask for test cases and code samples if needed.

## Reporting new issues

When [opening a new issue](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/issues/new/choose), always make sure to fill out the issue template. **This step is very important!** Not doing so may result in your issue not being managed in a timely fashion. Don't take this personally if this happens, and feel free to open a new issue once you've gathered all the information required by the template.

-   **One issue, one bug:** Please report a single bug per issue.
-   **Provide reproduction steps:** List all the steps necessary to reproduce the issue. The person reading your bug report should be able to follow these steps to reproduce your issue with minimal effort.

## Preparing

This is a monorepo managed with [`pnpm workspaces`](https://pnpm.io/workspaces/). Install pnpm globally with:

```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:sveltejs/language-tools.git
cd language-tools
pnpm install
pnpm bootstrap
```

## Building

To build all packages:

```sh
pnpm build
```

To watch for changes:

```sh
pnpm watch
```

## Code structure

### Packages

-   [`packages/language-server`](packages/language-server) - The language server for Svelte
-   [`packages/svelte-vscode`](packages/svelte-vscode) - The official VSCode extension for Svelte
-   [`packages/svelte2tsx`](packages/svelte2tsx) - Converts `.svelte` files into legal TypeScript/JSX
-   [`packages/svelte-check`](packages/svelte-check) - CLI tool for type checking and diagnostics
-   [`packages/typescript-plugin`](packages/typescript-plugin) - TypeScript plugin for Svelte intellisense

### Key entry points

-   `packages/language-server/src/server.ts` - Language server entry point
-   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/` - Language service plugins (TypeScript, Svelte, CSS, HTML)
-   `packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/index.ts` - Svelte to TSX transformation
-   `packages/svelte-vscode/src/extension.ts` - VSCode extension entry point

## Testing changes

### Running tests

Run tests for all packages:

```sh
pnpm test
```

Run tests for a specific package:

```sh
cd packages/[package-name]
pnpm test
```

### Testing in VSCode

To test your changes in VSCode:

1. Open the repository in VSCode
2. Go to the debug panel (Ctrl+Shift+D / Cmd+Shift+D)
3. Select "Run VSCode Extension" from the dropdown
4. Press F5 to launch a new VSCode instance with your changes

### Testing in other editors

For other editors, you'll need to build the language server and configure your editor to use the local build. See the documentation for your specific editor.

### Linking local changes

To test your local changes in a Svelte project, use [pnpm `overrides`](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides) in your project's `package.json`:

```jsonc
{
    "pnpm": {
        "overrides": {
            "svelte-language-server": "link:../path/to/language-tools/packages/language-server",
            "svelte-check": "link:../path/to/language-tools/packages/svelte-check"
        }
    }
}
```

## Pull requests

### Your first pull request

So you have decided to contribute code back to upstream by opening a pull request. You've invested a good chunk of time, and we appreciate it. We will do our best to work with you and get the PR looked at.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free video series:

[**How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub**](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

### Proposing a change

If you would like to request a new feature or enhancement but are not yet thinking about opening a pull request, you can also file an issue with [feature template](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).

If you're only fixing a bug, it's fine to submit a pull request right away but we still recommend that you file an issue detailing what you're fixing. This is helpful in case we don't accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.

### Sending a pull request

Small pull requests are much easier to review and more likely to get merged. Make sure the PR does only one thing, otherwise please split it.

Please make sure the following is done when submitting a pull request:

1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools) and create your branch from `master`.
2. Describe your test plan in your pull request description. Make sure to test your changes.
3. Make sure your code lints (`pnpm lint`).
4. Make sure your tests pass (`pnpm test`).
5. Make sure your code is properly formatted (`pnpm format`).

All pull requests should be opened against the `master` branch.
