# Syntax highlighting guide

## Info on TextMate

VS Code's syntax highlighting is written with the TextMate grammar. It's a grammar that makes heavy use of regular expressions. So make sure you brush up your skill on backward/forward references and lookarounds, because all these can be used. TextMate is a greedy grammar, which means that unlike normal regular expressions it will not backtrack. Once a match is found, that will be used. The other important thing is that the grammar can be nested, but children of a match can exceed the parent match and therefore push the boundaries of the parent match.

## Developing the grammar

The grammar for pug and markdown is written in JSON. You can edit that directly. The main grammar is written in `yaml` because that's easier to structure than JSON. However, VS Code expects a JSON format. Therefore you need to run the `build:grammar` script afterwards. This will produce a JSON version of the file. Afterwards you need to restart your extension window for the changes to take effect.

### Snapshot test for the grammar

The snapshot test is run by [vscode-textmate-test](https://github.com/PanAeon/vscode-tmgrammar-test). The `test` command called a node script to build the argument and execute the `vscode-textmate-test` command. If you updated the svelte grammar file, Be sure to add the test cases to the `test/sample` directory.

Then run the test to check if the update affect existing cases

```bash
yarn test
```

Update existing snapshot to match the changes

```bash
yarn test --updateSnapshot
```
