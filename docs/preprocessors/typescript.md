# TypeScript Support

[Official blog post](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-and-typescript)

## Setup

#### 1. Install the required packages and setting up your build

Starting fresh? Use the [starter template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template) which has a node script which sets it all up for you.

Adding it to an existing project? [The official blog post explains how to do it](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-and-typescript#Adding_TypeScript_to_an_existing_project).

#### 2. Getting it to work in the editor

To tell us to treat your script tags as typescript, add a `type` or `lang` attribute to your script tags like so:

```html
<!-- Add type="text/typescript" -->
<script type="text/typescript">
    export let name: string;
</script>

<!-- Or add lang="typescript" or lang="ts" -->
<script lang="typescript">
    export let name: string;
</script>
```

You may optionally want to add a `svelte.config.js` file - but it is not required as long as you only use TypeScript.

```js
const sveltePreprocess = require('svelte-preprocess');

module.exports = {
    preprocess: sveltePreprocess(),
};
```

#### 3. Restart the svelte language server

You will need to tell svelte-vscode to restart the svelte language server in order to pick up the new configuration.

Hit `ctrl-shift-p` or `cmd-shift-p` on mac, type `svelte restart`, and select `Svelte: Restart Language Server`. Any errors you were seeing should now go away and you're now all set up!

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

### How do I type reactive assignments? / I get an "implicitly has type 'any' error"

The following code may throw an error like `Variable 'show' implicitly has type 'any' in some locations where its type cannot be determined.`, if you have stricter type settings:

```html
<script lang="typescript">
    export let data: { someKey: string | null };

    $: show = !!data.someKey; // <-- `show` has type `any`
</script>

{#if show}hey{/if}
```

To type the variable, do this:

```ts
let show: boolean; // <--- added above the reactive assignment
$: show = !!data.someKey; // <-- `show` now has type `boolean`
```

### How do I import interfaces into my Svelte components? I get errors after transpilation!

-   If you use `svelte-preprocess` BELOW `v4.x` and did NOT set `transpileOnly: true`, then make sure to have at least `v3.9.3` installed, which fixes this.
-   If you don't use `svelte-preprocess` OR use `transpileOnly: true` (which makes transpilation faster) OR use `v4.x`, import interfaces like this: `import type { SomeInterface } from './MyModule.ts'`. You need a least TypeScript 3.8 for this.

### Can I use TypeScript syntax inside the template/mustache tags?

At the moment, you cannot. Only `script`/`style` tags are preprocessed/transpiled. See [this issue](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/4701) for more info.

### Why is VSCode not finding absolute paths for type imports?

You may need to set `baseUrl` in `tsconfig.json` at the project root to include (restart the language server to see this take effect):
```
"compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "."
  }
}
```
