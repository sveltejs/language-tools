# Svelte Language Server

Powering `svelte-check`, `Svelte for VS Code` and other IDE extensions who use it.

## Setup

Do you want to use TypeScript/SCSS/Less/..? See [Using with preprocessors](#using-with-preprocessors).

### Using with preprocessors

#### Language specific setup

-   [SCSS/Less](./preprocessors/scss-less.md)
-   [TypeScript](./preprocessors/typescript.md)

#### Generic setup

If a svelte file contains some language other than `html`, `css` or `javascript`, `svelte-vscode` needs to know how to [preprocess](https://svelte.dev/docs#svelte_preprocess) it. This can be achieved by creating a `svelte.config.js` file at the root of your project which exports a svelte options object (similar to `svelte-loader` and `rollup-plugin-svelte`). It's recommended to use the official [svelte-preprocess](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess) package which can handle many languages.

**Note**: `svelte-preprocess` supports passing an array of preprocessors (e,g, `preprocess: [postcss(), typescript()]`), but this is **not** currently supported by the language server.

```js
// svelte.config.js - NOTE: you cannot use the new "import x from y" and "export const" syntax in here.
const sveltePreprocess = require('svelte-preprocess');

module.exports = {
    preprocess: sveltePreprocess({
        scss: true,
    }),
    // ...other svelte options
};
```

It's also necessary to add a `type="text/language-name"` or `lang="language-name"` to your `style` and `script` tags, which defines how that code should be interpreted by the extension.

```html
<div>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
</div>

<style type="text/scss">
    div {
        h1 {
            color: red;
        }
    }
</style>
```

## Documenting components

To add documentation on a Svelte component that will show up as a docstring in
LSP-compatible editors, you can use an HTML comment with the `@component` tag:

```html
<!--
 @component
 Here's some documentation for this component. It will show up on hover for
 JavaScript/TypeScript projects using a LSP-compatible editor such as VSCode or
 Vim/Neovim with coc.nvim.

 - You can use markdown here.
 - You can use code blocks here.
 - JSDoc/TSDoc will be respected by LSP-compatible editors.
 - Indentation will be respected as much as possible.
-->

<!-- @component You can use a single line, too -->

<!-- @component But only the last documentation comment will be used -->

<main>
  <h1>
    Hello world
  </h1>
</main>
```
